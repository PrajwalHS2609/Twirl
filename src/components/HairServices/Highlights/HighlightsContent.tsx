          In today’s beauty landscape, hair highlights in Mangalore cater to all
          age groups and genders. Be it caramel, ash brown, honey blonde,
          burgundy, or even pastel hues, there is a wide palette of shades to

          One of the key reasons why people opt for hair highlights in Mangalore
          is the customization it offers. Unlike a full hair color treatment,
          highlights can be strategically placed to frame the face, add
          movement, and enhance hair volume. Balayage, ombré, babylights, and
          foil highlights are some of the most popular styles that salons in
          Mangalore provide. Each technique is tailored to suit individual
          preferences, whether one wants a sun-kissed natural look or a dramatic
          contrast. This personalized approach is what makes hair highlights in
          Mangalore a favored option for many beauty enthusiasts.
