          The term “Botox” in this context does not refer to the cosmetic
          procedure used for skin but rather to the concept of repairing and
          filling damaged parts of the hair fiber. Unlike keratin treatments

          Botox Hair Treatment in Mangalore is formulated using a combination of
          proteins, amino acids, vitamins, and antioxidants. When applied, the
          treatment penetrates deep into the cortex of the hair, repairing
          broken bonds and sealing the cuticles. This leads to hair that feels
          softer, shinier, and far more manageable. One of the reasons it’s
          growing in demand is because it is suitable for almost every hair
          type, including curly, wavy, straight, and even color-treated hair.

          also structural, as the treatment works from the inside out. The
          treatment not only helps in combating frizz but also significantly
          reduces breakage and split ends, which are major concerns for many in
