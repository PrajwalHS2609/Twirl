          What makes ombre gel polish different from regular polish is not just
          the look but also the durability. Gel polish is cured under a UV or
          LED lamp, allowing it to harden quickly and last much longer than
          traditional polish. At Twirl Salon, we take the extra step of prepping
          your nails thoroughly—cuticle cleaning, shaping, buffing, and
          priming—to ensure that the gel adheres properly and provides a strong,
          glossy finish. Many of our clients report that their ombre nails stay
          flawless for over three weeks with proper aftercare. So, when you book
          an appointment at the leading <a href="https://twirlsalon.com/spa-services-in-mangalore">Ombre Gel Polish Salon in Mangalore</a>, you
          can be confident that you're investing in long-term beauty and
